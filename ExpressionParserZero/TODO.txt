TODO: 
Functions - count parameters. Validate that count.
Function Matrices / Vectors. Flesh them out.In exception messages, show expression and error position marker.

Add this:
Error: Cannot do <operation> on types <left> and <right>. Call RegisterDelegate to allow such an operation. 

In FunctionMatrix and FunctionVector, lose the strName. => the same matrix can be used for '<=' and 'LTE'.
