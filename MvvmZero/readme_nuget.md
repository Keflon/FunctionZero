## Help improve Maui.MvvmZero
Most of my open-source starts out to fill a need in *my* production environment. This means 
I add features as I need them and I fix bugs as I encounter them. Your use-case will be different, 
so if you see room for improvement, please let me know and I'll see what I can do.

If you want to help:
- If you find any bugs please open a ticket.
- If you have a feature request you can let me know.
- If you use this, or any [other of my libraries](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/FunctionZero) 
please tell your friends, star the repo, or even consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/Keflon).
